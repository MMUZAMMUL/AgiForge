## Features

- **💬 Chat** — talk to any specialist with streaming responses.
- **⛓️ Agent Pipeline** — chain 2–6 specialists; each builds on the previous output. Run a full launch — Product Manager → Frontend Developer → Brand Guardian → Growth Hacker — in one tap.
- **✨ Auto-Build Team** — describe a goal; an orchestrator reads the full roster and assembles the right agents in the right order.
- **⚔️ Agent Debate** — two specialists argue in rounds (Proposer builds, Critic challenges) until a battle-tested answer emerges.
- **📊 Benchmarker** — run one prompt across many agents; an impartial judge model scores each on relevance, depth, and correctness.
- **▶️ Code Runner** — every code block gets a Run button, executed via the free Piston API (70+ languages).
- **🌍 10-Language Landing Page** — the [landing page](https://mmuzammul.github.io/AgiForge/landing.html) switches instantly between English, 中文, Español, हिन्दी, العربية, Português, Français, Русский, 日本語, and Deutsch — client-side, no reload, no third-party translation service.
- **📖 README in 10 languages** — this documentation is also available in [中文](README.zh.md), [Español](README.es.md), [हिन्दी](README.hi.md), [العربية](README.ar.md), [Português](README.pt.md), [Français](README.fr.md), [Русский](README.ru.md), [日本語](README.ja.md), and [Deutsch](README.de.md), with English as the canonical version.
- **🌐 Web Search** — optional real-time search via Brave Search API (bring your own key).
- **🎤 Voice Input** — Web Speech API, built into Chrome and Safari.
- **📎 File Attachment** — read code, CSVs, and docs as context, fully client-side.
- **🧠 Memory** — save, review, and delete outputs in `localStorage`.
- **⬇️ Export** — download any chat, pipeline, debate, or benchmark as a `.md` file.
- **🔄 Smart rate-limit handling** — on Groq's free tier, rotates across a 4-model pool and waits out `429`s so pipelines finish unattended.

See [`docs/FEATURES.md`](docs/FEATURES.md) for the full breakdown.

## Getting started (mobile, ~2 min)

1. Open **[mmuzammul.github.io/AgiForge](https://mmuzammul.github.io/AgiForge/)** on your phone.
2. Grab a **free Groq API key** at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com) (Google login, no card).
3. Paste it in **Settings → Connect**.
4. Pick a specialist and start building. Tap **Add to Home Screen** for an app-like experience.

> Your key is stored only in your browser's `localStorage` — it never touches a server.

## AI providers

| Provider | Cost | Setup |
|---|---|---|
| **Groq** | Free tier | Paste an API key in the app |
| **Ollama** | Free (local) | Run on a same-network machine |
| **Demo** | Free | No AI — previews the UI only |

## Architecture

AgentForge has **zero runtime dependencies** and **no build step**. The whole client is one file, `index.html`, which carries lightweight metadata (name, division, emoji, color, one-line description) for all 247 agents. Each agent's full system prompt is fetched on demand from this repo:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmuzammul/AgiForge/main/agents/<division>/<id>.md
```

This keeps the app small and fast to load while the prompts stay version-controlled and editable as plain Markdown. Full details in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

---

## Self-host

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MMUZAMMUL/AgiForge.git
cd AgiForge
# open index.html directly, or serve the folder:
python3 -m http.server 8080   # then visit http://localhost:8080
```

No npm, no framework, no toolchain. Deploy the folder to any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel). For GitHub Pages, enable **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions** — the included workflow auto-deploys on every push to `main`. See [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Contributing

New specialists and improvements are welcome — adding an agent is just a new Markdown file. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Privacy

No analytics, no tracking, no backend. The only network calls are to your chosen AI provider (Groq/Ollama) and, optionally, Brave (search) and Piston (code execution). Everything else runs in your browser.

## License
